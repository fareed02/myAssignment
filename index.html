                <p class="first">Today is the day that we go bacl to school. My family excited! We all think thats cool.
                </p>
                <p class="second">We all know that we'll have homework and study like crazy. We won't have a chance to
                    relax
                    and
                    be lazy.</p>

                <p class="third">We all wake up early in the morning. We'll find up our packs and hoist them and haul
                    them
                    to
                    school on our
                    backs.</p>

                <p class="fourth">I can’t wait to meet my new teacher
                    and all of my classmates and friends.
                    The first day of school is exciting,
                    though it’s sad summer break has to end.</p>
                <p class="fivth">We all get to meet and eat cookies.
                    We take assigned seats and learn names.
                    We write about summer vacation.
                    Then we play flashcards and games.</p>
                <p class="sixth">I really love summer vacation.
                    Swimming and biking’s so cool.
                    But still I can say that my favorite day
                    is the very first day that starts school.</p>

                vacations.</p>
